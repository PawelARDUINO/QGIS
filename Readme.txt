This plugin allows the user to generate a customized EU vector map within a mouse click.
In this plugin we use two existing shapefiles:  TM_WORLS_BORDERS-0.3.shp as well as EU_COUNTRIES_BOUNDARIES.shp
The first is taken originally from naturalearthdata.com while the second is a set of countries extracted from it.  
Information will be displayed by highlighting the values of selected fields in the attribute table from the EU_COUNTRIES_BOUNDARIES.shp 

The information comes from various sources between 2016 and 2019.  

The user have 8 options: 

-Population
-Population Density
-GDP per capita 
-Average Salary
-Life Expectancy
-CO2 Emissions
-Plain EU Map
-Global Fire Power

When finished just press the 'Exit' button.  

This plugin is mostly for relatively new QGIS users that will allow to generate a quick comparative EU map, or it can serve as a tool for advanced QGIS users in order to make a quick vector basemap for further work.

This plugin is created by Pawel Dzierzynski as part of the work of The Map Workshop.
